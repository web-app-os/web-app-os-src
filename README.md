1. Download a wao_all_beta_0_1_X.zip from GitHub

2. Extract to htdocs in Apache and change the folder name to the context name of the site

3. Construct a database  
 3-1. Create a ‘user’ and ‘database’ named same as context name  

 3-2. Create a system table of WAO on the database that you created at 3-1.  
 　　At this time, ‘OWNER’ should be same as ‘user’ which you create at 3-1.  
 　　[Arbitrarily folder]\site\db\sql\webappos_ddl.sql

4. Alter the setting folder  
 4-1. Set WAO  
　　[Arbitrarily folder]\site\conf\wao_config.ini
 　　[WebAppOS Settings]  
 　　enable_SSI: If you implement HTML file with Apache using SSI, you should turn ‘ON’.  
 　　In other case, turn ‘OFF’.  
 　　webapps_path = the place of WAO’s system file　outside of web  
 　　[Environment Settings]  
 　　ant_home = the directory in which ‘Ant’ was installed.  
 　　tomcat_home = the directory in which ‘Tomcat’ was installed.  

 4-2. Change the setting for the website  
 　　[Arbitrarily folder]\site\conf\default\site_config.ini

[An arbitrarily folder]\wao\bin\deploy.bat

8. Access from a browser  
http://localhost:8080/'context name’/

♦Minor update
